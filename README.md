## 1 Description 

Chow Chow is a fictional restaurant located in NYC that serves gourmet food for expensive prices. It specializes in steak. The name comes from the cute dog breed "Chow Chow" which is where the play on words comes from. 

### 1.1 Project Goals 

To create a website that is designed so that a user can book an appointment at the restaurant on a specific date and time with ease of use. While preventing double bookings acorss those dates and times. I want it to be easy to navigate across all devices with good readability.
