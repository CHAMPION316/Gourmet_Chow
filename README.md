## 1 Description 

Chow Chow is a fictional restaurant located in NYC that serves gourmet food for expensive prices. It specializes in steak. The name comes from the cute dog breed "Chow Chow" which is where the play on words comes from. 

### 1.1 Project Goals 

To create a website that is designed so that a user can book an appointment at the restaurant on a specific date and time with ease of use. While preventing double bookings acorss those dates and times. I want it to be easy to navigate across all devices with good readability. 

### 1.2 UX

I decicded to go with the main color of pink since it's a happy color but also a romantic color. I want this restaurant to be connected with "dating" which is the vibe I'm going for. The 3 main colors I chose were created using the website [coolors](https://coolors.co/)

Here is the color palette I have come up with:
- [Chow-color-palette](static/img/chow-color-palette.png) 

The logo was designed by me using photoshop but first created rough draft ideas in OneNote. Here are images showcasing that. 
- [Sketch logo ideas](static/img/chow-roughdraft-logos.jpg)

### 1.3 User Stories 

- As a user, I expect to navigate the website with ease of use.
- As a user, I expect to find the food menu as fast as possible.
- As a user, I expect to find the restaurants phone number as fast as possible. 
- As a user, I expect to find the restaurants address as fast as possible.
- As a user, I expect to book a table with a number of guests. 
- As a user, I expect to cancel my booking if plans change before hand. 
- As a user, I expect to be able to download the menu as a pdf if possible. 
- As a user, I expect to combine multiple tables if we have more than the guest limit for bookings.
- As a creator, I expect the user to find what they need on the main page.
- As a creator, I expect the user to find the address of the restaurant within the first 45 seconds.
- As a creator, I expect the user to enjoy a simplistic menu that isn't all over the place. 

### 1.4 Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create all my wireframes:

|    Desktop   |    Tablet    |    Mobile    |
|    :----:    |     :----:   |    :----:    |

##  2 Features 

### 2.1 Existing Features

All of my pages consist of the same navigation menu bar or hamburger icon for mobile devices. This format allows the user to understand where everything is located at all times for simplicity. The main page has a footer at the bottom with the address, phone number, and social media links. (I am currently working on whether the footer will be implemented on all pages except the menu page.) My color palette was created using [https://coolors.co/](https://coolors.co/). I decided to use 3 colors listed below in RGB format. 

The color palette was done using [coolors](https://coolors.co/) as seen by the image here [collage](static/img/chow-color-palette.png)


At this point in time I only have the index.html page running but will implement the rest as I just worked on the wireframes for the rest of the site. 

[**The Navbar**](static/img/phone-navbar.png) includes links to **Home Page** - **Menu Page** - **Reservation Page** - **About Page** 
- [**Home Page**](static/img/phone-main-page.png) allows the user to navigate to the main page.
- [**Menu Page**](static/img/phone-menu-maincourse.png) allows the user to view the food menu.
- [**Reservation Page**](static/img/phone-reservation-page.png) allows the user to place a reservation with a date and time.
- [**About Page**](static/img/phone-about-page.png) allows the user to learn more about the restaurant and it's history.

[**The Header**](static/img/phone-main-page.png) : Contains an image of the inside of a restaurant that I got form [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/wine-glasses-on-table-tops-941861/) which is a website that allows users to use images for free. 

[**Section**](static/img/phone-main-page.png) : Contains a colored background with an image of a dish that the restaurant serves with a brief description about the restaurant. 

[**The Footer**](static/img/phone-main-page.png) : includes:

- **Address details**: includes a contact email to contact the owner.
- **Phone Number**: newsletter so clients can stay up to date with new material and more.
- **Social Media Links**: Links to the restaurants social media pages. 

### 2.2. Features left to implement in the future

- Create the backend for the website that allows functionality between colliding dates and times.
- Create a downloadable pdf version of the food menu by adding a clikable link to the page.
- Add a google maps image of the address when on the **Reservation Page** page or have google maps open when clicking on the address on the footer.
- Have a notification window pop up when clicking on the phone number on the footer that allows one to make the call directly without having to type the numbers manually.

## 4. Testing

- The testing process was done on a separate file [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)
- As it stands now this is the testing results for the **index.html** page and the **style.css** stylesheet

## 5. Improvements

- Allow the logo image on the main page to shrink and increase in size when the window is altered instead of having a set size for devices.

## 6 Deployment

**How to deploy the project**

This project is hosted in GitHub Pages

1. On the menu on the top of the project‚Äôs repository on GitHub select **Settings**.
2. Scroll down to the GitHub **Pages** section.
3. Inside that section, click on the drop-down menu under **Source** and select **Main Branch**.
4. The page refreshes automatically and the website is now deployed.
5. The link to the webpage is just in the GitHub **Pages** section down below.

Only one branch has been used for this project.

**To run the project locally**

To clone this project from GitHub:

1. Under the repository‚Äôs name, click **Clone or download**.
2. In the **Clone with hTTPS** section, copy the given URL.
3. In your IDE of choice, open **Git Bash**.
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
5. Type **git clone**, and then paste the URL copied from GitHub.
6. Press **enter** and the local clone will be created.

### 6.1 Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
